     <h2> Is FlyOS a system? Why is there an os? </h2> 
     <p>Some people say that FlyOS is not os, but FlyOS can be said to be one of termux's linux distributions (referring to the rootfs transformation under data), so it is os. FlyOS is not like other scripts, but single The file, there is no dependency. And it is mentioned in the chapter on the origin of flyos that FlyOS was originally a rom, so we did not change the name, but it is also an os now. </p>
